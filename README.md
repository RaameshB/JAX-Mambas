# JAX-Mambas
This is a repo where I (attempt to) implement all of the 3 major Mamba varients in JAX + Flax's NNX API. 
Likely order of implementation:
1. Pure mathematical formulations as described in the papers
2. Stability tricks used in the official repos (may or may not get all of them)
3. Pallas implementations of their CUDA kernels

## Implementation Progress:
- [ ] [Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752):
  - [ ] Mathematical Form (still need to implement recurrent form)
  - [x] Stability Tricks
  - [ ] Pallas Kernel
- [ ] [Mamba-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21060):
  - [ ] Mathematical Form
  - [ ] Stability Tricks
  - [ ] Pallas Kernel
- [ ] [Mamba-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21060):
  - [ ] Mathematical Form
  - [ ] Stability Tricks
  - [ ] Pallas Kernel

### Notes:
- Models will be called "naive" when they are implemented without their kernels
